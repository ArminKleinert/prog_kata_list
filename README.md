# A short list of very general katas

A list of short and not so short katas for programming languages in general. Depending on your language of choice, some of the tasks may be harder or easier. Adjust the points if need be. The points should roughly reflect the number of minutes needed to solve a problem without looking up a solution.

For some tasks, examples are given in different languages. Others might follow.

To make something clear, just doing a simple wrapper is not ok:
```
def my_awesome_bubblesort(list)
  return buildin_bubblesort(list)
end
```

## Learn, have fun, enjoy! :)
